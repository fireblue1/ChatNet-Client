The ChatNet Client utilizes a "Gift of Asychrounous Babble" (GAB) chat server designed by Dr. William Oropallo. The GAB server utilizes WebSockets to connect to clients and distribute messages between them. The GAB Server files and README (renamed oldREADME) have been forked from Dr. Oropallo, and can be found in the **GAB Server** folder.
