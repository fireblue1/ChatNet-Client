# ChatNet - Gift of Asynchronous Babble Chat Client

##### Designed by Mihail Kaburis for CIS 4930 Advanced JavaScript (Spring 2019)

## GAB Server
The ChatNet Client utilizes a "Gift of Asychrounous Babble" (GAB) chat server designed by Dr. William Oropallo. The GAB server utilizes WebSockets to connect to clients and distribute messages between them. The GAB Server files and README (renamed oldREADME) have been forked from Dr. Oropallo, and can be found in the **GAB Server** folder.
